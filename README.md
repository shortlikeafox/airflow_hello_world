# airflow_hello_world
* Simple Airflow Project to Help Debug VSCode Airflow Issues
* Specifically I was having Terminal issues when launching VSCode inside of a container and I am using this simple repo to help diagnose out what is wrong
* Use this for whatever you want
* docker-compose up --build builds the project
